# AutoAdb

This command-line tool allows to execute a command whenever a new device is
connected to adb.

For example, to execute `printf` on device connection:

```bash
autoadb printf 'Device connected\n'
```

`{}` replaces the `serial` of the device detected:

```bash
autoadb printf 'Device %s connected\n' '{}'
```

It may be used to start [scrcpy]:

```bash
autoadb scrcpy -s '{}'
```

## Build


```
cargo build --release
```

It will generate the binary in `target/release/autoadb`.


## Cross-compile from Linux to Windows

To build `autoadb.exe` from Linux, install the cross-compile toolchain (on
Debian):

    sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64
    rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

Add the following lines to `~/.cargo/config`:

    [target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
    linker = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
    ar = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-ar"

Then build:

    cargo build --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

It will generate `target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/autoadb.exe`.


## For beginners - How to run AutoAdb:

1) Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2) Build:

```
cargo build --release
```

It will generate the binary in `target/release/autoadb`


3) Set the $PATH for autoadb or simply: 

cd into autoadb/target/release/ and execute using ```./autoadb```

e.g. to start scrcpy: ```./autoadb scrcpy -s '{}'```


## Licence

This project reuses the mechanism I implemented in [gnirehtet] and expose it as
a standalone tool, so the licence is the same.
